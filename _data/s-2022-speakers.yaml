    title: "DevSecOps by Default : What have, can and must we learn from Log4Shell?"
    abstract: "\n\nIt’s been a couple of months since Log4Shell ruined many Christmas holidays for developers, architects, ITOps and especially Dev(Sec)Ops teams. How did this incident help us strengthen our software supply chain? How have DevSecOps adopted their delivery and operations orchestration to prevent using vulnerable code or react faster once a new breach is detected?\n\nIn this session we cover stories from DevSecOps teams that were on the frontlines when Log4Shell hit. We look into application security approaches and tools to detect vulnerabilities during delivery as well as in production and see how open source projects such as Falco, Keptn and others help DevSecOps teams to enforce a “Secure by Default” policy!"

    title: "Feedback : You don't have to be bad to get better"
    abstract: "\n\nWhen coaching my three daughters and their soccer teams for over 15 years, I started each season with a discussion about my philosophy about feedback. My mantra is that you don’t need to be bad to get better. I am coaching you not because I think you’re terrible but because I see true potential in you and I want you to be better. I carry that into my professional life and the relationships with my coworkers and my teams.\n\nWe are not good at feedback, both giving and receiving. It can be uncomfortable to hear that you could have done better. It is awkward to give direct and honest feedback when the message is “you did not meet my expectations.” Usually the receiver is left feeling inadequate. The truth is that we need to change our culture such that feedback becomes a gift. A gift that is given to someone that we care about. A gift that is received from someone that we respect.\n\nWhether the feedback is verbal or written, from a person 1:1, from your teammates during a retrospective or information from your tools or pipelines, it should be embraced for your journey of continuous improvement. It is mandatory for a learning organization. It is imperative for Agile and DevOps! There are some important guidelines that should be followed for this to be successful and I will go into them in depth."

    title: "From Infrastructure as Code to Environment as Code : Challenges scaling IaC and how to resolve them"
    abstract: "\n\nInfrastructure as Code(IaC) has made managing infrastructure easier in a lot of ways, but there are many challenges that companies accept as the cost of adopting IaC especially when scaling. IaC is good at provisioning individual resources (or a few of them together) but engineering teams want an entire environment with various components like networking, platform (ec2/eks), database, s3 buckets, etc. to deploy and operate their applications.\n\nTo provision and tear down an entire environment, these teams have two options. They can either hand roll pipelines to manage individual resources and then manage complex dependencies between these resources within those pipelines or create a monolith IaC for the entire environment. These approaches are inefficient and slow down feature development and innovation. They also make replicating, visualizing & understanding environments difficult. What if there were a better way?\n\nThis talk digs into these challenges to try to better understand them and then look at how to resolve them. We will introduce Environment as Code (abstraction over IaC) that enables teams to provision & teardown entire Environments in an efficient way and promotes best practices like loosely coupled infrastructure resources."
