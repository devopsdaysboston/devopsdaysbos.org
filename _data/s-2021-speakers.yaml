  title: Communication and Empathy across Remote and Distributed Teams
  abstract: |-
    Over the past year and a half, the world went a bit sideways, and as a result, many companies went fully remote and are considering staying remote in some fashion. Some folks suddenly found themselves working remotely for the first time or working with teammates who have never worked remotely before, and that situation likely won’t change. However, working remotely means adopting different communication strategies and finding ways to empathize with coworkers without socializing or discussing things in person, and many folks still attempt to engage the same way as when they congregated in an office every day. The difficulties for remote and distributed teams around communication and empathy get even worse when tossing in high-emotion situations like incidents and being on-call.

     Let’s explore:
     * how communication and empathy across remote and distributed teams is different than for in-person teams,
     * why these differences arise, and
     * what teams and individuals can do to improve communication and to create and maintain empathy on remote teams, from using communication frameworks to helping others learn how to empathize with you.

  title: So. Many. Vulnerabilities. Why are containers such a mess and what to do about it.
  abstract: |-
    What’s with all of these container image vulnerabilities? I’m a developer, not a security analyst! Whether you’re a solo dev or a large team embracing DevSecOps, join me to learn practices I’ve seen successful teams using to build safer container images & avoid the mistakes they made along the way.

    If you’ve even run a vulnerability scan on a container you’ve probably seen it: the dreaded list with 100s, maybe even 1000s of issues on it. Containers have made life simpler in so many ways, but security sometimes doesn’t feel like one of them. So what can we do about it?

    In this talk, I’ll share what I’ve learned working with users and companies and the best practices I’ve picked up along the way to builds safer container images. I’ll also share what not to do, because there are many rabbit holes you can go down that end up wasting time and energy.

    I’ll share the processes and patterns that you can use whether you’re working on an individual project, or you’re part of a bigger team embracing DevSecOps.

  title: Shifting Left on Production Excellence with Observability
  abstract: |-
    My goal for this talk is to show DevOps practitioners and leaders what’s possible with next-generation observability tooling. Production should be for everyone, and there’s significant business risk in waiting to take these steps. Those risks come in the form of obvious pain like downtime as well as more insidious problems like attrition. And with rampant burnout across the industry, the way we currently operate production software is unsustainable.

    Here’s a brief outline of what I plan to cover in the 30 minutes:

    * intro - DevOps means production ownership. how to make it safe?
    * what is production excellence?
    * event-based service level objectives
    * observability + progressive delivery
    * next steps - how to bring observability to your org

  title: Kubernetes
  abstract: |-
    Kubernetes is probably the de-facto container orchestrator for most people using container orchestrators. There is a huge demand for it as well as a lot of interest among people to learn Kubernetes. I like most people wanted to learn how it all worked. And don’t get me wrong the docs for Kubernetes are great. The community as a whole also created many tutorials, blog posts, videos books etc. But I still find something is missing. The intro tutorials are too basic sometimes. They are great if you want to learn the architecture of Kubernetes and how it all fits together. There are some real advance use case tutorials that dive deep in one aspect of K8s. But there is missing link.

    I hope to help bridge that with this session. We will look at what I call second week of learning Kubernetes. You got the idea behind Kubernetes. You have played a bit with minikube. You have deployed the nginx server. But whats next?

    We will talk about other lesser known but important features of k8s. We will tackle things like rollout, rollback, resource quotas, private image registry, continuous deployment and many more. You know, the second week stuff !!

  title: Are your CI/CD Pipelines Secure?
  abstract: |-
    Most CI/CD pipelines used by DevOps teams utilize integrations with services such as APIs, databases and other critical systems to complete their workflows. These integrations usually required the use of extremely sensitive secrets such as passwords, tokens or certificates and must be securely protected at all times. Unauthorized access of these pipeline secrets open these systems to threats from bad actors and illegal access of data.

    In this talk Angel will discuss common pain points in properly securing applications, CI/CD pipelines and protecting sensitive access gates to integration targets. Attendees will learn strategies to secure their applications, sensitive data and pipeline integration points. Attendees will leave with a better understanding of how to implement security layers that can improve their pipeline security posture.

  title: Preventing Developer Burnout
  abstract: |-
    All professionals deal with challenging, high-stress and/or high-pressure situations. Everyone has their limits, and too much stress or pressure can lead to “burnout,” a state of physical and emotional exhaustion. Burnout takes its toll not only on the individual but also co-workers, team, friends, and family. By working together, individuals and managers can avoid burnout.

    This session explores the dangers of burnout and the negative impact it has on teams and individuals. We will review the three main types of burnout: Frenetic, Under-Challenged, and Worn-Out. Attendees will walk away with the ability to identify, treat, and prevent burnout in themselves and others.

  title: Load Testing AWS Serverless Architectures with Serverless
  abstract: |-
    Serverless architectures on AWS, involving services like AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, Cognito, Step Functions, API Gateway, bring instant scalability when built and configured in the correct way. We’ll look at how AWS Serverless architectures need to be treated differently to ensure optimal scalability and how Serverless tools (like Serverless Artillery) can be used to verify scalability.

    Not only will we look at achieving scalability, we’ll also look at the tools and techniques to predict and limit the cost of scaling. To bring these topics to life we’ll look at the architecture of 2 live Serverless applications built on AWS for scale and discuss how they were architected, how costs were monitored and kept in line and how serverless load testing was used to verify scalability and catch edge cases.

  title: The Life of On-Call, how SRE is changing DevOps
  abstract: |-
    Google did it again. They gave us another buzzword that is changing how organizations operate. Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) is both a strategy and in some organizations brand new function that helps complete the DevOps lifecycle. In this session we will talk about how the SRE function is changing the way organizations think about on-call and completing the DevOps feedback loop from prod to plan. We will cover:

    1. The rise of the SRE role
    2. How the SRE function is not rooted in monitoring and ops anymore
    3. How high-performing teams are leveraging SRE to advance their delivery chain
    4. What modern on-call looks like
    5. Best practices and Considerations

    If you are in IT operations, development, SRE or DevOps this talk will help frame the overall objectives and responsibilities of the SRE function, and new ways to approach on-call.

    Prior to Shoreline, I spent 7.5 years at Amazon Web Services (AWS), where I ran their analytic and relational database services. Within analytics, this included Athena, Data Pipeline, EMR, Glue, LakeFormation, Managed Blockchain, and Redshift. Within relational databases, these were Aurora for MySQL and PostgreSQL and RDS for MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server. Managing services deployed on millions of nodes while ticketing on a per-instance basis taught me the importance of distributed control and automation.
  title: Restarts and rollbacks don't fix everything
  abstract: |2-
    As our systems grow exponentially larger and more complex, the challenge DevOps and SREs face to keep production systems online also grows. In order to get ahead of ticket queues and improve availability, there’s an imperative for us to automate remediation of issues entirely. This is more attainable than most people realize because while the causes of an incident may be in the thousands, the number of remediations is usually small and consistent.

    In this session, I’ll describe real outages I saw at AWS, group them into their common infrastructure resolutions, and describe how we built speculative, automated resolutions that reduced tickets, improved availability, and reduced costs while growing our fleet 1000x. You’ll walk away with concrete ideas that you can put into place to improve availability and reduce burnout.
